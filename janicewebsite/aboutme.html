  <h1>Get to Know Me Beyond My Career</h1>

    <h2>My Passion for Dance üíÉüèΩ</h2>
    <p>
      Dance has been a huge part of my life for almost 20 years ‚Äî not just as a hobby, but as a way to inspire others and express myself creatively. 
      I‚Äôve had the privilege of teaching and choreographing for students ages 5 to 65, specializing in Bollywood, semiclassical, hip-hop, and fusion styles.
    </p>
    <p>
        I took my first dance class at just three years old, and it has been something I kept in my heart ever since. I started with ballet and tap, then transitioned
        into jazz and commercial while still keeping my culture alive by learning Bollywood and Bengali folk. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As a dance instructor, I love creating an encouraging, inclusive space where students can grow their confidence, embrace cultural diversity, and discover the joy of movement. 
      I enjoy designing lessons, planning performances, and seeing the excitement when students achieve something they didn‚Äôt think was possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        I love giving back to the community, and through dance I was able to partner up and collaborate with non-profit organizations by performing at their events
        and aid in raising money for their causes (money for children hospitals, schools, funerals, churches, and much more).
    </p>
    <p>
      Dance has also taught me valuable life skills ‚Äî teamwork, time management, problem-solving, and even how to handle challenging situations with patience and grace. 
      These lessons go far beyond the dance floor and shape how I approach my personal and professional life every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plus, dancing is one of my favorite ways to stay active and relieve stress ‚Äî it‚Äôs fun, energizing, and always keeps me smiling!
    </p>
